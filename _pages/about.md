Hello! I am a Digital Humanities graduate student at the University of Alberta, Co-President of the Digital Humanities Student Association, and a member of the CRYPT Lab led by Dr. PB Berge. I also teach Professional Communications at MacEwan University.

As a storyteller, I create narratives across poetry, fiction, interactive stories, and games. My work focuses on queer and feminist issues, and explores trauma, neurodivergence, and self-exploration. My current research challenges patterns of gendered exclusion in videogame culture, from 'girl game' movements to game design interventions. 

When not on campus, I am likely scheming the demise of my loyal D&D players, overthinking my farm layout on *Stardew Valley*, buying books faster than I can read them, or trying to convince my cats that it's not meal time *yet*.
