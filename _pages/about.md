Adeline (she/they) is a Digital Humanities graduate student at the University of Alberta and a sessional instructor at MacEwan University. As a storyteller, she explores narratives across various mediums, including poetry, fiction, interactive stories, and games. Their academic work focuses on queer and feminist issues, and her creative work explores trauma, neurodivergence, and self-exploration.

When not on campus, Adeline is scheming the demise of her loyal D&D players, overthinking her farm layout on Stardew Valley, buying books faster than she can read them, or trying to convince thier cat that it's not meal time *yet*.
